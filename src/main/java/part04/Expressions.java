// SECTION A — FOLLOW ALONG: type the code from the video (or the guide) in this class.
//    His class is called Main. Yours is called Expressions.
//    Leave the "package part04;" line and the "public class Expressions" line alone.
//    Type everything else yourself.

// SECTION B — COMMENTS: when you finish, put a // comment ABOVE every line of code,
//    saying in YOUR OWN WORDS what that line does. The README shows an example.

public class Expressions {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double friends = 10;
        //creates a double variable named friends and assigns it the value of ten
        friends = (double) friends / 3;
        //cast the result to a double and assign it to friends
        System.out.println(friends);
        // prints the value of friends.
